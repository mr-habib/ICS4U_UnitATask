A .docx document is simply a zipped up file that contains a bunch of xml documents that describe how the document should look. The xml documents describe the encoding of the word document and tells programs like Mircrosoft Word how to output them to the screen.

Your job will be to take a word document and use python to extract the plain text from that document.
I've gone ahead and added some boilerplate code that extracts only the important xml document and places it in your current folder.

I encourage you to play around with this. I extract the xml for you, but see if you can see what's going on under the hood of a doc file.

Your output should be a file called ```plaintext.txt``` that contains all of the plin text. I've included ```plaintext_totc.txt``` so that you can see what your program should output.


If you need any further assisstance, please do not hesitate to ask.

## Important
1. Please comment your code. 
2. Use good variable names following proper pyton convention (snake_case)
3. You will be marked on coding style and program correctness
4. If your program does not compile, ask me what's up and I'll help... if it does not compile after the due date, you will be losing marks.
5. Have fun
